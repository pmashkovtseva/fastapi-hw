# fastapi-hw

This is the first DevOps homework assignment, made by me, [Polina Mashkovtseva](https://github.com/pmashkovtseva).

`main.py` file contains FlaskAPI app with several methods extensively described [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qtHEGCl2gpLxOR7CJPOC40tHp4hwYL5_/view).

The app is also hosted on https://fastapi-hw-s89x.onrender.com.

See https://hub.docker.com/r/pmashkovtseva/fastapiimage for Docker image.
